**Notes on the data analysis competencies**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Abstract</span>

After going into this module with very little knowledge on data science as a whole, taking on 3 of the recommended Datacamp courses was to my impression the best I could have done. Giving me all the necessary tools needed to carry out an investigation with popular and widely supported libraries, these 3 courses covered all the basics of data science from a rather broad perspective. Although the learning was of course dependent on the appropriate note taking technique, this was achieved by simply writing down every code snippet along with a short explanation of what it did and how. Taking these notes consistently throughout each individual course allowed me to refer back to previous knowledge for problems during the courses. As well as helping me retain the information provided in these same courses.
