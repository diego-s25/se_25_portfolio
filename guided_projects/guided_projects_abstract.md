**Guided data projects**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Abstract</span>

Datacamp’s guided data projects were an ideal follow up to the python/pandas/seaborn basics courses, mainly because of how they allowed me to put the freshly acquired knowledge to practice. Helping me even further to retain said knowledge and also giving me good insight into how I can/should use it to solve “real world problems”. The projects’ clear and straightforward structure made them easy to follow, but they still required me to look back to my notes and effectively apply what I had recently learned. From descriptive statistics to data visualizations, the problems posed in the projects made for a good recap of sorts from the earlier courses, while still requiring me to look for new methods on my own in order to solve said problems.
