**Preliminary analysis of an own project**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Abstract</span>

Coming up with an own project was by far the hardest of all 3 tasks, mainly due to the task of matching a meaningful (to me) problem, with available data and the potential of a solution/answer through data science. Knowing I wanted to do something related with my home country of El Salvador, the first step of finding a sufficiently good dataset was completed thanks to a rather large dataset on a wide range of indicators from the World Bank. Then after taking into consideration the available data, deciding to try and answer whether El Salvadorâ€™s economy is actually improving or declining. Finally putting all my recently acquired knowledge to practice with a clear view of what I had to work with, and what I was looking to produce with it. Firstly cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, to then apply methods for descriptive statistics and data visualization that would help answer the investigations main question. Making use of my notes from the datacamp courses and other external resources such as StackOverflow, I was able to reach satisfying results from a preliminary analysis.
